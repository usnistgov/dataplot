INSTALLATION FROM PACKAGES

There are a large number of Linux/Unix distros and each of these distros
typically provide a package manager for binary installations of software.
This section documents the Red Hat Package Manager (RPM).  Thanks to Chris
Schanzle for putting the RPM package together.

You typically need super user privleges to create and run packages.

 1. Red Hat Package Manager (RPM):


    1a. INSTALLING PRE-BUILT RPM's:

           i) Download the appropriate RPM for your distro and architecture
              from

                https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/software/dataplot/ftp/unix/homepage.htm.

          ii) "cd" to the directory where the file was downloaded.  This often
              defaults to ~/Downloads, but this will depend on how you have
              configured your browser.

         iii) Perform the install with

                sudo yum install ./dataplot-20200521-1.el7.x86_64.rpm

              The name of the Dataplot ".rpm" file may vary slightly
              from the above depending on the date and the specific
              system.

              The date "20200521" given in the above line may vary depending 
              on when the specific RPM was created.

        Note yum will install any required dependencies.

    1b. BUILD YOUR OWN RPM

        RPM packages are generated for a specific version of the
        operating system.  We have a limited number of systems on
        which to build the RPM packages, so you may want to create
        your own.
 
        A "dataplot.spec" file is included in the dataplot sources which is
        the recipe to create the binary packages.  To create the RPM
        package, do the following

             src/buildrpm.sh

        We tested with Fedora 29 Server, Fedora 30 and CentOS 7.6 minimal
        install.

Package managers for other systems (e.g., Ubuntu) are under consideration
but are not yet available.   We are aware of packages created for other
Linux distros, but we are not involved in their creation.  If you have
created a Dataplot package for other package managers and would like to
contribute it to the Dataplot web site, please contact Alan Heckert at
alan.heckert@nist.gov.

SOURCE BASED INSTALLATION

If you are installing Dataplot on a system for which you cannot
use the RPM file, you can build Dataplot from source.  It is
assumed that you have gfortran/gcc already installed.

We currently build Dataplot from source for CentOS, Fedora, Cygwin,
Ubuntu, Manjaro (an Arch derivative), and MSYS2 (Windows).

 1. Download the zip file

    From

       https://github.com/usnistgov/dataplot

    select the "Close or Download" menu and then select the
    "Download ZIP" option.  This will download the file

           dataplot-master.zip

    Move this file to a convenient location and then enter

       unzip dataplot-master.zip

    After the files are unpacked, you should have a "src"
    directory and a "lib" directory.

    Alternatively, you can perform the download and unpack with the
    following command

        curl -L https://github.com/usnistgov/dataplot/tarball/master  | tar -xz

 2. Build from source

    There is a Makefile in the "src" directory.

    You should check the "PREFIX=..." and the "FEATURES=..." lines.  The
    following comments in this section give more detail, but most users
    should be able to just check those 2 lines before running make.

     i. The line

          PREFIX=...

        should be set to the directory where you want to
        install Dataplot.  If you have super user permissions,
        you typically want to set this to either "/usr" or
        "/usr/local".  If you do not have super user permissions,
        you would typically set this to either "$HOME" or
        "/var/tmp".

    ii. The line

           FEATURES = GD TIFF CAIRO X11 READLINE NCURSES

        specifies external dependencies that Dataplot can utilize.
        Specifically,

        a. READLINE - this enables the readline library for command
                      history and editing.  If you enable this feature,
                      you need to enter the following command in Dataplot
                      to activate this 

                         SET READ LINE ON

                      If you enable READLINE, you should also include
                      NCURSES on the FEATURES line.

        b. GD - this enables the GD graphics library.  This allows
                Dataplot to generate graphs in JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP,
                and, optionally, TIFF and webp formats.  You can
                also read images in these formats.

                Note that the addition of the TIFF and webp formats
                is relatively recent.  Enterprise versions of Linux
                may have an older version the GD library that does
                not include support for TIFF and VPX.

                To enable TIFF, you need to include TIFF on the
                FEATURES line.  To enable webp, include VPX on the
                FEATURES line.

                Dataplot does not currently utilize the TIFF and VPX
                libraries independent of GD.

        c. CAIRO - this enables the Cairo graphics library.

                   The Cairo device in Dataplot should be considered
                   "beta".  

        d. X11 - this enables the X11 graphics library.

                 The Dataplot X11 device driver only uses the
                 libX11 library, so this feature only loads that
                 specific library.  The CAIRO and PLOT features
                 will add a number of additional X11 libraries.

        e. PLOT - this enables the libplot (plotutils) graphics
                  library.  This adds several device drivers not
                  otherwise available in Dataplot (Adobe Illustrator,
                  binary CGM, netPBM image format).

        f. OPENGL - this enables the OpenGL device driver.  This driver
                    is still under development, so this feature should
                    NOT be enabled at this time.

        f. GKS - this enables a GKS device driver.  This feature should
                 NOT be enabled.  This driver is unlikely to ever
                 be activated for production versions of Dataplot.

        g. AQUA - this enables the Aquaterm device driver for MacOS.
                  This feature should NOT be enabled for non-MacOS
                  systems.

        These features should only be enabled if the appropriate
        libraries are installed on your system.  In particular, you
        will need the developer versions installed (default Linux
        installations will typically have most of these libraries
        installed, but the developer libraries may not be).  The
        method for installing the developer libraries will depend on
        what variant of Linux you are running.  For Ubuntu (and other
        systems that use the apt package manager) systems, you can
        install the relevant developer libraries with

            sudo apt install libx11-dev; # For X11

            sudo apt install libgd-dev; # For GD
            sudo apt install libfreetype6
            sudo apt install libfreetype6-dev

            sudo apt install libplot2c2; # For PLOT
            sudo apt install libplot-dev

            sudo apt install readline; # For READLINE
            sudo apt install readline-dev

            sudo apt install libcairo-dev; # For CAIRO

        If your platform uses a different package manager, you
        will need to do something similar.  If you are not
        familiar with how to do that, you can just use

            FEATURES = X11

        Although the other features provide useful capabilities, none
        are essential to running Dataplot.

   iii. The line

           DP1FLAGS = -DDDOUBLE -DINTEGER32 -DHAVE_ISNAN -DHAVE_EXECUTE_COMMAND_LINE -DDPLIBDIR=\'$(DPLIBDIR)\'

        contains compilation switches for the file that contains
        Dataplot's operating system dependent code.  If you have older
        versions (say 4.6 or older) of gcc/gfortran, you should remove
        "-DHAVE_EXECUTE_COMMAND_LINE".  If you have really old versions
        of gcc/gfortran (say 4.2 or older), you should remove
        "-DHAVE_ISNAN".

    iv. The lines FFLAGS and CCFLAGS define the default compilation
        options for gfortran and gcc, respectively.

        The default for gfortran is

           -O2 -DLINUX -fdefault-real-8 -fdefault-double-8

        The -O2 sets the optimization level.  You can remove this
        if you want to turn the optimization off.  The -DLINUX
        option activates Linux specific code in the source and
        should be left on.  The "-fdefault-real-8 -fdefault-double-8"
        defines both single precision and double precision to be
        64-bits.  On 64-bit machines, we advise against promoting
        double precision to 128-bits due to the fact that certain
        special function routines from the CMLIB/SLATEC libraries
        do not work correctly in 128-bit mode.  We hope to correct
        this in a subsequent release so that double precision can
        use the full 128-bit capability.

        The default for gcc is

           -O2

     v. Dataplot's default workspace is 10 columns by 1,500,000
        rows.  You can re-dimension to obtain more columns at the
        expense of fewer rows.  If your local machine has sufficient
        memory, say 16GB or more, and you would like to increase the
        maximum number of rows, then you can do the following

          1. Edit the following line in the file DPCOPA.INC:

                PARAMETER (MAXOBV=1500000)

             to specify the maximum number of rows.  How high
             you can go will be dependent on how much memory
             you actually have.

          2. Add the following option to both FFLAGS and CFLAGS

               -mcmodel=medium

    After you have made any needed modifications to the Makefile, enter

        make
        make install

    If you are installing Dataplot to "/usr" or "/usr/local", then use

        sudo make install

    If the "bin" directory for Dataplot is not in your current path,
    then add it to your path.  For those who use the Bourne shell, do
    something like (typically this can be added to your .bashrc file)

       export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin

    For the c-shell, do something like (typically this can be added
    to your .cshrc file)

        set path=($path /usr/local/bin)

 4. To test the command line version of Dataplot, enter

       dataplot
       device 1 x11
       call minitest.dp
       quit

    To test the GUI version of Dataplot, enter

       xdataplot

 5. There are two configuration files that you may want to edit
    at some point.

       a. The "/usr/local/lib/dplogf.tex" file contains a
          startup file that will be executed when you initiate
          Dataplot.  This is an ASCII file containing Dataplot
          commands that is useful for specifying your own defaults
          for Dataplot.  The default version for Linux is essentially
          a place holder (i.e., it doesn't really do anything).

          If you would like to create your own custom file , then
          do the following

             cp /usr/local/lib/dplogf.tex ~/dplogf.tex

          Then edit ~/dplogf.tex using any ASCII editor.  If you
          have a dplogf.tex file in your home directory, this will
          override the system version.

          How much you would like to utilize dplogf.tex is a
          personal preference.

       b. The "/usr/local/lib/frscript/xdpConfig" file is a
          configuration file for the GUI.  In general, you will not
          need to edit this file.  However, if you would like to
          create your own custom version, then

             cp /usr/local/lib/frscript ~/xdpConfig

          This is an ASCII file.  As with dplogf.tex, a copy of
          xdpConfig in your home directory will override the
          system version.  See the comments in xdpConfig for
          guidance in editing this file.
